How to build:
    make (make sure you have JFlex installed)

How to run:
    edit INPUT_FILE in the Makefile to whatever you want, then run `make run`

Running our personal tests:
    We built a test suite for each type error. To run the test suite, just run `make test`.
    Success means that it errored out as we expected. 

    The output of each test is stored in the "actual_output" folder under the "tests" folder.
